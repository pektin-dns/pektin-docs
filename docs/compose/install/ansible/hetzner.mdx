# Hetzner Cloud

This is meant to be a one click install on Hetzner Cloud.
(Provided you don't need to login/register)

:::caution
This will cost money! The hcloud plugin will auto buy/rent the necessary servers.
The basic setup will rent 1 virtual server and cost you `4.15€` per month.

:::tip

in cloud credits to tinker arround with. If you like their service and stick arround to spend at
least 10€ of actual money we will get 10€ in cloud credits ourselves.
