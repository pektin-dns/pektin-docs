## What is opinionated?

These things are opinionated although many of them can be expanded on or adjusted manually if needed.
We chose these things to make it easier to provide the features that we needed/wanted.

-   No support for every last DNS type (Supported are: AAAA, A, SOA, NS, MX, SRV, TXT, TLSA, OPENPGPKEY)
-   Replication between multiple authoritative servers is done via Redis not via DNS
-   No recursion
-   DNSSEC only with method 13 (ECDSA-P256-SHA256)
-   DNSSEC is standard
-   DNSSEC signing is offloaded to Vault
-   Primary focus is deployment to container environments (Docker, Kubernetes etc.)
-   Redis as data store
-   Uses Traefik as proxy

## Why host your own DNS server?

-   coolness
